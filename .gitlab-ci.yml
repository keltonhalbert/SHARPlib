# Use the official RHEL8 Universal Baseline Image (UBI) 
# to build and test SHARPlib using CMake.

image: redhat/ubi8

# Before doing anything, we need to make
# sure the required libraries are installed
# on the image, and initialize submodules
before_script:
  - dnf update -y && dnf install -y cmake gcc gcc-c++ git
  - git submodule update --init --recursive

## The CMake build step
build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - cmake -B build .
    - cmake --build build -j 4
    - cmake --build build -j 4 --target SHARPlib_tests
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - build 
      # depending on your build setup it's most likely a good idea to cache outputs to reduce the build time
      # cache:
      #   paths:
      #     - "*.o"

# run tests using the binary built before
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - cd build
    - ctest
