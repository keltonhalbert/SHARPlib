    "# **SHARPlib -- Lifting Parcels**\n",
    "This is a tutorial notebook on how to conduct parcel lifting operations using SHARPlib. \n",
    "\n",
    "SHARPlib has a bit of a different take on parcel lifting relative to existing libraries, allowing for configurable moist adiabats and pseudoadiabats as part of the API. This also means that the API is a little more verbose, since rather than providing a one-size-fits-all function to do this, it instead provides composable functions to achieve a desired end result. If that sounds confusing, don't worry too much about it! You'll soon see how you can use the different building blocks within SHARPlib to do some rather interesting computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the SHARPlib API for parcel lifting is much more verbose than other available implementations, a quick refresher on what CAPE and CINH are could be useful. In order to facilitate customization and flexibility, the API was designed around the mathematical representation first. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"font-size:150%\">$$\n",
    "CAPE = \\int_{\\mathrm{LFC}}^{\\mathrm{EL}} \\frac{T_v - T_{\\mathrm{env}}}{T_{\\mathrm{env}}} \\, dz\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "CINH = \\int_{\\mathrm{LPL}}^{\\mathrm{LFC}} \\frac{T_v - T_{\\mathrm{env}}}{T_{\\mathrm{env}}} \\, dz\n",
    "$$\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "**LPL** is the height of the **Lifted Parcel Level** (originating level), **LFC** is the height of the **Level of Free Convevtion**, **EL** is the height of the **Equilibrium Level**, $T_v$ is the **parcel virtual temperature**, $T_{env}$ is the **environment virtual temperature**, and $dz$ is the **delta in the height coordinate**. So, looking at these equations, we can see that in order to get CAPE, we need to integrate buoyancy... and to get buoyancy, we need the parcel virtual temperature... and to get the parcel virtual temperature, we need to define parcels to lift, and how we want them lifted. This is how the tutorial will be structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Step 0: Imports and Loading Data**\n",
    "Before we can get started, we need to import the modules we would like to use, and load some testing data provided with the repository. The data are stored in the Apache Parquet format, which Pandas can read as long as a compatible Parquet reader is installed (e.g. pyarrow, fastparquet).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we are using is from a real weather balloon launch -- **2016-05-24 1900 UTC at Dodge City, Kansas**. It is a raw, full resolution dataset with a sample every 1-second during the balloon ascent, containing several thousand vertical levels. This much data can be slow to process in pure-Python (for example, in SHARPpy) so it makes for an excellent example to show how powerful SHARPlib can be. However, because it is a real-world field data source, it isn't exactly clean. It contains some missing values and requires unit conversion, so a convenience function is provided below for data loading. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good time to tell you that SHARPlib expects you to be responsible for your own data formatting and pre-processing, though it does have internal QC checks for missing values. It expects all data to be in base metric units -- Pascals, Kelvin, meters / second, g / g, etc. -- rather than relying on any unit conversion libraries. "

    "## **Step 1: Configuring the Moist Adiabats**\n",
    "SHARPlib currently supports two different \"parcel lifters\" that can be used to compute moist ascent. The first is the Wobus lifter, which is an approximation derived by mathematician Henry Wobus and is computationally efficient. The Wobus lifter is also the method traditionally used by the SPC in its sounding and mesoanalysis computations. However, as discussed in [Davies-Jones 2007](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/136/7/2007mwr2224.1.xml), it can result in errors in the parcel temperature over 1K, and some of the assumptions in the derivation of the Wobus lifter don't hold up. The alternative provided by SHARPlib is to use the calculations from [Bryan and Fritsch 2004](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/132/10/1520-0493_2004_132_2421_aroiwp_2.0.co_2.xml), which are used in Bryan's Cloud Model 1 (CM1) to compute CAPE/CINH. The CM1 parcel lifting approach can be configured for adiabatic and pseudoadiabatic ascent, each with the ability to include or exclude ice phase processes. We'll go through how to configure these parcel lifting routines in the following cell. "

    "Sometimes, non-zero integration ranges (e.g. 0-3 km CAPE) are desired. So far, the only CAPE/CINH integration we've seen has been \"automatic\", whether its been the calls to ```parcel.Parcel.cape_cinh```, or the ```parcel.Parcel.most_unstable_parcel``` convenience function. Additionally, it may have felt that the process of getting CAPE/CINH has been verbose compared to the older approach in SHARPpy... but this verbosity enables a lot more flexibility in how your interact with the library, as you will see below. \n",
