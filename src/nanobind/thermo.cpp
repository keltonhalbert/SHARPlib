Computes the difference between the wet-bulb potential temperatures
(Kelvin) for saturated and dry air, given the temperature (Kelvin).

The Wobus Function (wobf) is defined as the difference between the 
wet-bulb potential temperature for saturated air (WBPTS) and the 
wet-bulb potential temperature for dry air (WBPTD) given an iput
air temperature. This function is used in the computation of moist 
adiabatic ascent as part of the Wobus parcel lifter (lifter_wobus).

WOBF(T) := WBPTS - WBPTD

Although WBPTS and WBPTD are functions of both pressure and 
temperature, it is assumed their difference is a function of 
temperature only. The difference is also proportional to the 
heat imparted to a parcel of air.

This function uses a polynomial approximation to the wobus function, 
fitted to value in Table 78 of PP.319-322 of the Smithsonian Meteorological
Table by Rolan List (6th Revised Edition). Herman Wobus, a mathematician 
for the Navy Weather Research Facility in Norfolk, VA computed these 
coefficients a very long time ago, as he was retired as of the time of 
the documentation found on this routine written in 1981.

It was shown by Robert Davies-Jones (2007) that the Wobus function has
a slight dependence on pressure, which results in errors of up to 1.2
Kelvin in the temperature of a lifted parcel. 

Parameters:
    temperature: The air temperature (Kelvin)

Returns:
    The Wobus function temperature (Kelvin)
